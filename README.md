# ðŸ’¼ Sales Management System â€” SQL-Based Data Analytics Project

This project demonstrates a real-world approach to using **SQL** for sales analysis, customer segmentation, and business performance tracking. Through structured queries, we extract key metrics from a sales database â€” including revenue trends, high-value customers, and product profitability â€” suitable for business intelligence reporting, dashboards, and executive decision-making.

- Design SQL queries to derive business KPIs
- Track monthly and quarterly revenue performance
- Identify high-spending customers and top-performing products
- Use structured SQL to replace spreadsheet-based reporting
- Build portfolio-ready assets for real-world business analysis
